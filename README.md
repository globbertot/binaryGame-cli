# binaryGame-cli
A simple terminal-based game where the player has to guess either the binary or decimal representation of a randomly generated number.

# How to Play #
  1) Clone this repository or download the script.
  2) Open a terminal and run the script using Python:
    `python binary_game.py --bits <number of bits>`
  (Replace <number of bits> with the desired bit length, for example `--bits 8` for 8-bit binary numbers.)

  3) The game will ask you to guess either the binary or decimal     representation of a number.
  
  4) Use the hints to help you make guesses.

Make sure to keep track of your score, and see how many rounds you can solve correctly!

# Example #
`$ python binary_game.py --bits 8`
This will start the game with 8-bit binary numbers, this is also the default bit number.
